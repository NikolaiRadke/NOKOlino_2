# About the versions
  
## V1.0  
This is the original release, used in this wiki. Works fine.

* A place for a 220k resistor and connectors for a SFH300 photo transistor were added.  
* The holes for the strain relief were reinforced.  

## V2.0
This version was never released. It went into a wrong direction.

## V3.0 
This release is not compatible with older firmware and adds the following enhancements:  
* Light redesign for easier assembly. The battery can be attached more easy by two pins.  
* Nokolino now supports new music box mode.
