# PCB - How to get your own NOKOlino boards

**19.11.2018**  

NOKOlino_2 is made of **two** boards. Both of them are 6x5 cm, with two layers: The **main board** for the Buttons, 
the charging module, the ATtiny and the MP3 module, the **top board** for the Speaker. The battery is on the 
downside of the main board.  
  
There are **three** ways to get your own set of boards:

1.  Upload the [gerber files](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/NOKOlino_2/tree/master/schematics/gerber) to a PCB manufactor
of your choice. in China, you can order a set of 10 boards for about 15€ in less then three weeks. If you are in a hurry, 
you can choose express shipping. But be careful: in Germany, if your order has a value more than 22€ including shipping costs, you have to pay taxes and a processing fee, which also takes additional time! So try to keep your or order **below 22€**! if you need help, feel free to contact me. Order specifications: two layers and standard presets like PCB thickness 1.6.  
 
2. I am still looking for a way to sell NOKOlino as a complete kit. Unfortunatly, the heise-Verlag is not willing the sell the kits anymore :-(. Please be patient and see topic 3.   
 
3. Contact me. I have some boards and few kits left. But please: First try to order them by yourself as written in option 1.
